# Commands

Exact slash-command syntax, plus a prompt cookbook. Most day-to-day use doesn't
need this - see the README's "Try this first" for the plain-language path.
Back to [README](../README.md).

## Direct commands

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `/run <agent> [task]` | Run one agent; omit the task for self-contained agents |
| `/chain agent1 "task1" -> agent2 "task2"` | Run agents in sequence |
| `/parallel agent1 "task1" -> agent2 "task2"` | Run agents in parallel |
| `/run-chain <chainName> -- <task>` | Launch a saved `.chain.md` or `.chain.json` workflow |
| `/cohort-doctor` | Show read-only setup diagnostics |

Commands validate agent names locally, support tab completion, and send results back into the conversation.

### Per-step tasks

Use `->` to separate steps and give each step its own task:

```text
/chain scout "scan the codebase" -> planner "create an implementation plan"
/parallel scanner "find security issues" -> reviewer "check code style"
```

Both double and single quotes work. You can also use `--` as a delimiter:

```text
/chain scout -- scan code -> planner -- analyze auth
```

Steps without a task inherit behavior from the execution mode. Chain steps get `{previous}`, the prior step's output. Parallel steps use the first available task as a fallback.

```text
/chain scout "analyze auth" -> planner -> worker
# scout gets "analyze auth"; planner gets scout output; worker gets planner output
```

For a shared task, list agents and place one `--` before the task:

```text
/chain scout planner -- analyze the auth system
/parallel scout reviewer -- check for security issues
```

### Inline per-step config

Append `[key=value,...]` to an agent name to override defaults for that step:

```text
/chain scout[output=context.md] "scan code" -> planner[reads=context.md] "analyze auth"
/run scout[model=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4] summarize this codebase
/parallel reviewer[skills=code-review+security] "review backend" -> reviewer[model=openai/gpt-5-mini] "review frontend"
```

| Key | Example | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `output` | `output=context.md` | Write results to a file. For `/chain` and `/parallel`, relative paths live under the chain directory; for `/run`, relative paths resolve against cwd. |
| `outputMode` | `outputMode=file-only` | Return only a concise file reference for saved output instead of the full saved content. Requires `output`; default is `inline`. |
| `reads` | `reads=a.md+b.md` | Read files before executing. `+` separates multiple paths. |
| `model` | `model=anthropic/claude-sonnet-4` | Override model for this step. |
| `skills` | `skills=planning+review` | Override injected skills. `+` separates multiple skills. |
| `progress` | `progress` | Enable progress tracking. |

Set `output=false`, `reads=false`, or `skills=false` to disable that behavior explicitly. Do not use `output=false` for file-only returns; use `outputMode=file-only` with an `output` path.

### Background and forked runs

Add `--bg` to run in the background:

```text
/run scout "audit the codebase" --bg
/chain scout "analyze auth" -> planner "design refactor" -> worker --bg
/parallel scout "scan frontend" -> scout "scan backend" --bg
```

Add `--fork` to start each child from a real branched session created from the parent's current leaf:

```text
/run reviewer "review this diff" --fork
/chain scout "analyze this branch" -> planner "plan next steps" --fork
/parallel scout "audit frontend" -> reviewer "audit backend" --fork
```

You can combine them in either order:

```text
/run reviewer "review this diff" --fork --bg
/run reviewer "review this diff" --bg --fork
```

Background runs are detached. If the parent agent has other independent work, it should keep working. If it has nothing useful to do until the background result arrives, it should end the turn instead of running sleep or status-polling loops. Pi will deliver the completion when the run finishes.

The `oracle` and `worker` builtins are designed for an explicit decision loop. A typical pattern is to ask `oracle` for diagnosis and a recommended execution prompt, then only run `worker` after the main agent approves that direction.

## Clarify and launch UI

Chains open a clarify UI by default so you can preview and edit the workflow before it runs. Single and parallel tool calls can opt into the same flow with `clarify: true`; slash commands launch directly.

Common clarify keys:

- `Enter` runs in the foreground, or in the background if background is toggled on
- `Esc` cancels or backs out
- `up down` moves between steps or tasks
- `e` edits the task/template
- `m` selects a model
- `t` selects thinking level
- `s` selects skills
- `b` toggles background execution
- `w` edits output/write behavior where supported
- `r` edits reads where supported
- `p` toggles progress tracking where supported

Picker screens use `up down`, `Enter`, `Esc`, and type-to-filter. The full-screen editor supports word wrapping, paste, `Esc` to save, and `Ctrl+C` to discard.

## Prompt cookbook (appendix)

Everyday phrasing beyond the README's headline examples. All of these are ordinary Pi requests - Pi decides whether to call `subagent`, which agent to use, and whether a chain or parallel run makes sense.

```text
Ask oracle for a second opinion on my current plan. Challenge assumptions and tell me what I might be missing.
```

```text
Use oracle to help solve this hard bug. Have it inspect the code and propose the best next move before we edit anything.
```

```text
Run parallel reviewers on this diff. I want one focused on correctness, one on tests, and one on unnecessary complexity.
```

```text
Have worker implement this approved plan. Afterward, run parallel reviewers, summarize their feedback, and apply the fixes that make sense.
```

```text
Run a review loop on this change until reviewers stop finding fixes worth doing, with a max of 3 rounds.
```

```text
Use scout to understand the auth flow, then have planner turn that into an implementation plan.
```
